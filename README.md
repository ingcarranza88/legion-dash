##Legion Dash
=============
### A Foundation Based Project


The Story
---------------------------------
So in the making of the legion framework I needed a dashboard layout. When I looked at my options 
I found loads and loads and loads of Bootstrap based dashboard templates with a fixed side nav thats resposive
and so many other features but NONE FOR FOUNDATION !!! :( oh dear foundation developers

So I started work on this. . . A foundation based one page parallax scrolling template / dashboard template
The reason I have said that it can be used for both is it will look nice as a one page site but will also 
with a small amount of adaptation work as a dashboad template with a fixed sidebar and eventually movable configurable panels

Features
---------------------------------
- Built With Foundation At its core
- Uses Foundations Latest Icon Fonts
- Very Simple Parallax Scrolling Effect with deep linking navigation so that index.html#about goes to that section
- Fixed Sidebar that resposive and off canvas for mobile/tablet

Installation
---------------------------------
I WOULDNT YET
