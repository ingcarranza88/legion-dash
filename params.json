{"name":"Legion-dash","tagline":"","body":"##Legion Dash\r\n=============\r\n### A Foundation Based Project\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story\r\n---------------------------------\r\nSo in the making of the legion framework I needed a dashboard layout. When I looked at my options \r\nI found loads and loads and loads of Bootstrap based dashboard templates with a fixed side nav thats resposive\r\nand so many other features but NONE FOR FOUNDATION !!! :( oh dear foundation developers\r\n\r\nSo I started work on this. . . A foundation based one page parallax scrolling template / dashboard template\r\nThe reason I have said that it can be used for both is it will look nice as a one page site but will also \r\nwith a small amount of adaptation work as a dashboad template with a fixed sidebar and eventually movable configurable panels\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n---------------------------------\r\n- Built With Foundation At its core\r\n- Uses Foundations Latest Icon Fonts\r\n- Very Simple Parallax Scrolling Effect with deep linking navigation so that index.html#about goes to that section\r\n- Fixed Sidebar that resposive and off canvas for mobile/tablet\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n---------------------------------\r\nI WOULDNT YET\r\n\r\nLICENCE \r\n---------------------------------\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Jason Demitri - Relution Ltd\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
